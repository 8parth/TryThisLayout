# TryThisLayout
An android app which will never let you forget any birthday, annieversary or any important dates. Ever.

The application fetches user's contacts with birthdays and stores it in application's own database.
With help of this data, user is notified about birthdays.

Things are going to be implemented: 
-Facebook integration, Twitter integration to get user's friendlist and related birthday and other events
-For now just birthdays reminder is implemented, but I want to add annieversary and other important dates, too.

Anybody to contribute and fix issues, is welcome.
